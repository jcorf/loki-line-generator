"On my way down to coordinate search and rescue."  I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?
I am Loki of Asgard.
And I am burdened with glorious purpose.
I...
Never mind.
Don't touch that.
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry. Who's "us"?
It's been a very long day,
and I think I've had my fill of idiots
in armored suits telling me what to do,
so, if you don't mind,
this is actually your last chance.
Now get out of my way.
What is this place?
You're making a terrible mistake.
It's the Tesseract.
Be very careful with it.
Know this.
You cross me,
there are deadly consequences.
Hey, hey!
Absolutely not.
This is fine Asgardian leather.
Now, hang on just a minute.
What?
Oh, this is absurd.
What? "To my knowledge"?
Do a lot of people not know
if they're robots?
What if I was a robot
and I didn't know it?
Okay, I'm not a robot, so I'll be fine.
What?
Oh, what's that?
What's that?
There's only two of us in here.
This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!
Time-Keepers? The Sacred Timeline?
Who actually believes this bunkum?
Madam, a god doesn't plead.
This has been a very enjoyable pantomime,
but I'd like to go home now.
Guilty of being
the God of Mischief? Yes.
Guilty of finding
all this incredibly tedious? Yes.
Guilty of a crime
against the Sacred Timeline?
Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.
I suspect, the Avengers.
I came into possession of the Tesseract
because they traveled through time,
no doubt in a last-ditch effort
to stave off my ascent to God King.
Oh, believe me, you can smell
the cologne of two Tony Starks.
You speak of Time Criminals?
It's they you should be after.
Perhaps you could provide me
with a taskforce and resources,
and I could return
and eliminate them for you.
Oh, no?
Right. Uh...
"Not supposed to happen"?
According to whom?
Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right.
Well, perhaps I should speak
to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.
Oh, they are? What are they doing?
I see. Right. And then what do you do?
Guilty... of this.
Hang on. Everyone quiet.
Don't rush me. 
Damn it! Why won't it work?
"Reset"? What does that mean?
What, is it bad? What does it mean?
Hey! You ridiculous bureaucrats
will not dictate how my story ends!
You have no idea what I'm capable of!
And who are you?
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.
I thought there was no magic here.
That's not real.
This place is a nightmare.
Are you taking me somewhere to kill me?
I don't like to talk.
How long have you been here?
What does that mean?
So, you're part of the TVA's
courageous and dedicated workforce?
You were created by the Time-Keepers.
To protect the Sacred Timeline.
The idea that your little club
decides the fate of trillions of people
across all of existence
at the behest of three space lizards,
yes, it's funny.
It's absurd.
For the record, this really does feel
like a killing-me kind of a room.
Trust is for children and dogs.
There's only one person you can trust.
If the TVA truly oversees all of time,
how have I never heard of you until now?
I live within whatever path I choose.
What do you want from me?
Not my forte.
You don't know anything about me.
Like myself?
Finish what I started.
Claim my throne.
I don't want to be, I was born to be.
You wouldn't understand.
Midgard.
Asgard, the Nine Realms.
Space.
Mock me if you dare.
I would've made it easy for them.
The first
and most oppressive lie ever uttered
was the song of freedom.
For nearly every living thing,
choice breeds shame
and uncertainty and regret.
There's a fork in every road,
yet the wrong path always taken.
The Time-Keepers
have built quite the circus,
and I see the clowns are playing
their parts to perfection.
I am smart.
What is this?

No.
And I remember. I was there.
Anything else?
You know, things didn't turn out so well
for the last person who said that to me.
Little solace to a dead man.
Your games don't frighten me.
I know what I am.
A liberator.
I don't have to play this game. I'm a god.
No, I don't suppose you do.
What can I say? I'm a mischievous scamp.
I fail to see how this has
any relevance or bearing on...
I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor.
Where was the TVA when I was meddling
with these affairs of men?
So that had the Time-Keepers'
seal of approval, did it?

Enough.
I was just standing up to make a point.
It won't be as meaningful now.
I'll do what I want to do!
What exactly is it that you want?
Liar.
I know what this place is.
It's an illusion.
It's a cruel, elaborate trick
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.
A desperate attempt at control.
Now, you all parade about
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.
You're not.
My choices are my own.
Precisely.
I was...
I am on the verge of acquiring
everything I am owed,
and when I do, it'll be because I did it.
Not because it was supposed to happen.
Or because you
or the Time Variance Authority,
or whatever it is you call yourselves,
allowed me to.
Honestly, you're pathetic.
You're an irrelevance.
A detour.
A footnote to my ascent.
MOBIUS: If you hadn't picked up the Tesseract,
you would have been
taken to a cell on Asgard.
What is this?
This is nonsense, more tricks.
This never even happened.
This is absurd.
Where do you have her? Where is she?
I don't believe you.
You're lying. It's not true.
Where is she?
I don't believe you.
I'll kill you.

What is this place?
Hey.

What's your name?
Give me the Tesseract,
or I'll gut you like a fish, Casey.

How do you not know what a fish is?
Well, what difference does it make?
Death, Casey. Violent, painful death.
What?
Infinity Stones?
How...
How do you have these?
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

Glorious purpose.

I can't go back, can I?
Back to my timeline.
I don't enjoy hurting people.
I... 
I don't enjoy it.
I do it because I have to,
because I've had to.
Because it's part of the illusion.
It's the cruel, elaborate trick
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.
A villain.
Oh, several times. Even an Infinity Stone is useless here.  The TVA is formidable.
And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?
Why me?
I beg your pardon?
How long have you been here?
Now, you parade about
as if you're the divine arbiters
of power in the universe.
Infinity Stones?
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?
I can't go back, can I?
And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?
Why me?
Very bad things.
It's when the TVA can
no longer reset a nexus event.
Okay? Boring.
Can you hear me?
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?
Ah.
You can't hide...
Yeah.
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.
Very subtle. Well done.
Oh, your only hope
of capturing a murderer?
Lovely.
Duplication-casting.
No, they're two
completely different powers actually.
Illusion-projection involves depicting
a detailed image from outside oneself,
which is perceptible
in the external world,
whereas duplication-casting
entails recreating
an exact facsimile of one's own body
in its present circumstance,
which acts as a true holographic mirror
of its molecular structure.
But you already knew that.
That's me.
Do I get a weapon?
Well, I'll have my magic back.
Is no one concerned about that?
Me betraying you.
Why not?
An audience
with the Time-Keepers is on the table?
Let me ask you this,
why don't we just travel
back to before the attack,
when the Variant first arrives?
Well, as many as I could stand.
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.
Reset charges prune the affected
radius of a branched timeline,
allowing time to heal all its wounds.
Which, by the way, sounds like a nice way
of saying "disintegrate
everything in its vicinity."
I watched the videos.
I mean, some of them.
I think you underestimate, actually...
Wait...
If you leave this tent,
you'll end up like them.
I see a scheme,
and in that scheme, I see myself.
We have a saying in Asgard,
"Where there are wolf's ears,
wolf's teeth are near."
It means to be aware of your surroundings.
Which is absurd, because my people are,
by nature, gullible fools.
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,
exploited time and time again
simply by listening.
My teeth were sharp,
but my ears even sharper.
You remind me of them.
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.
Those you underestimate will devour you.
You underestimate me,
just as you
underestimate this lesser Loki.
Which is why, you walk into
one wolf's mouth after another.
That's exactly what
the Variant wants you to do.
It's a trap.
He's waiting for you outside this tent.
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.
He knows that I'm stronger than him.
And he rightly believes that together
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.
But that's not what I want.
I have a new purpose.
I am a servant of the Sacred Timeline.
Knowing
what I now know about his tactics,
I can deliver you the Variant...
but I need assurances.
Assurances that I won't be
completely disintegrated
the moment the job has been done.
We'll need to speak
to the Time-Keepers at once.
They're in graver danger than we realized.
You're probably wondering
what happened out on the mission.
That was your first lesson
in catching a Loki.
Expect the expected.
Half the fun of being a trickster
is knowing everyone knows
you're a trickster, and then,
many of your tricks
can come from exploiting
the fact that you know that they know...
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?
Hang on.
I'm not sure "superior"
is actually quite the right word.
Very nice.
I mean, it is adorable that you think
you could possibly manipulate me.
I'm ten steps ahead of you.
I've been playing a game
of my own all along.
Okay. Why are you in there
sticking your neck out for me?
I don't need your sympathy.
What's this then?
The next step of your manipulation...
Oh, and what does my desperate
last chance require?
Work?
Well, you're idiots.
I suspect you probably missed a lot.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed
and killed another team of Minutemen.
 And stole
their reset charge as well.
Shh.
Hi.
Hello?
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.
Follow-up to a field mission.
You know how it goes.
We red lined near the apex, and...
Well, it's never good. 
Um, I'd like all files pertaining
to the creation of the TVA, please.
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining
to the beginning of time then.
Okay, the end of time.
Okay, what files can I have?
I found something.
I have.
Yes.
The answer isn't in the files,
it's on the timeline.
He's hiding in apocalypses.
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?
Yes, very sad.
Anyway, it got me thinking...
Nexus events
happen when someone does something
they're not supposed to do, right?
Great. And then that thing
they're not supposed to do,
cascades into a whole range of other
things that aren't supposed to happen.
And so on and so forth, until eventually,
a new timeline branches. Yes?
Exactly. So, let's just say...
...your salad is Asgard in this scenario.
It's a metaphor. Just hang in there.
And I could go down to Asgard
before Ragnarok
causes its complete destruction
and I could do anything I wanted.
I could, let's say,
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.
There he goes.
And I could also...
Set fire to the palace.
Okay? I can do whatever I want to do,
and it would never matter.
It wouldn't go against the dictates
of the timeline because...
Excuse me?
Nice to see you.
I just need this for a second. Thanks.
Because the apocalypse is coming.
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy
Asgard no matter what I do.
There's the apocalypse.
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.
Ragnarok.
There it is.
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor.
But you see what I mean.
It doesn't matter.
It could be any apocalypse.
It could be a tidal wave.
It could be a meteor.
It could be a volcano, a supernova.
If everything and everyone around you
is destined for imminent destruction,
then nothing that I say or do will matter,
because the timeline's not gonna branch.
'Cause it gets destroyed.
Hence, the Variant could be
hiding in the apocalypse
and do whatever he wants,
and we wouldn't know!
Take me to a real apocalypse,
take me to Ragnarok, I'll show you.
No, I'm not going home.
We can go anywhere.
Oh, Mobius, come on!
What could possibly go wrong?
We gotta properly test this theory.
I'd never stab anyone in the back.
That's such a boring form of betrayal.
Well, I'd never do it again,
because it got old.
Okay, look, you don't trust me,
you can trust one thing.
I love to be right.
Here we go.
Until this entire town
is wiped off the face of this planet.
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...
Oh, come on! It's cool.
They're all gonna die anyway.
Okay.
Oh, Mobius! You make even
the end of the world sound boring.
Okay.
Yes. Yes.
Very small.
Bird noises?
Oh.
Go! 
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

My name is Loki. We are agents of the Time Variance Authority.
I bring you all dark tidings.
All of you!
You're all about to die.
That volcano is about to erupt!
I would know, because I'm from the future.
 We are
from the future, right?
What is the TVA?
I mean, it's from the future.
It sounds from the future.
It's pretty future-y.
Right on cue! 
Enjoy your last meal while you can!
Nothing matters!
Nothing has any consequence!
Dance while you still can!
Whoo-hoo!
How'd we do?
The TVA would never
even know we were here.
If it were me, this is where I would hide.
You're welcome.
How many of those disasters could there possibly be?
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?
Yes.
Why do you have that?
Because they're awesome.
I suppose they are.
You ever been on one?
It'd be fun, though.
So, why read about them?
I mean, you really believe
in all this stuff, don't you?
Three magic lizards...
...created the TVA, and everyone in it...
...including you?
Every time I start
to admire your intelligence,
you say something like that.
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.
Odin of Asgard.
It's not the same.
It's completely different.
It's not the same.
Fair enough. You believe it's real.
So everything is written.
Past, present, future.
There's no such thing as free will.
So, in fact, in a way,
you and I here at the TVA,
we're the only ones who are actually free.
How does it all end?
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers.
What are they waiting for?
Ah, I see. So, when they're finished,
what happens then?
Only order?
No chaos? It sounds boring.
You know, you called me a scared little boy.
You did.
You're wrong, though.
You see, I know something children don't.
That no one bad is ever truly bad.
And no one good is ever truly good.
Yes, it was quite patronizing.
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.
I know.
Why does that matter?
What's that?
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.
Sure.
Yeah.
Uh...
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.
Or the tsunami of 2051.
2050.
The extinction of the swallow...
Is that a thing?
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.
No Kablooie.
Got him.
That's where he is.
I thought so too.
What, good enough for a face-to-face
with the Time-Keepers?
All right. One step at a time.
The bad Loki, preferably.
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.
So I don't announce myself with every
squeaky footstep like the rest of you.
Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.
You can trust me.
I understand
I have to earn that, so, I will.
I for one am glad we're getting
to spend this time together.
I'm saying we got off on the wrong...
In this storm?
I mean, I probably would have
worn a suit, but... yes, maybe.
Is he dead?
Me, I presume.
How nice to meet you.
Enchantment is a clever trick.
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.
I'm working for me.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?
Show yourself.
You know, gaining their confidence
was no mean feat.
If you could possibly sheathe
your smarm for a moment,
I have an offer for you.
That's why I found you.
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.
And, uh, cards on the table,
I could use a qualified lieutenant.
What say you...
Loki?
God. Now I understand
why Thor found this so annoying.
Listen, enough with your games.
I've been trying to help you.
I kept them vulnerable
at the Renaissance Fair for some time.
If you don't wanna rule the TVA,
then what do you want?
I think you'll find
I'm well ahead of schedule.
I found your hiding place like that.
I'd say that makes me
the superior Loki, wouldn't you?
I see. That's your plan.
Lure us all here
so you can blow the place up.
I miss Randy.
You're the first person
to tell me that.
I would never treat me like this.
Hi.
Oh, come on. Stop hiding.
Loki, if you had any honor
you'd fight me as yourself.
Enough!
What do you want from me?
What is this about?
Right.
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?
The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.
He's hiding in apocalypses.
Me, I presume.
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.
What do you want?
A few questions.
Rude.
Are you sure you're a Loki?
You are my way.
I thought perhaps we could work together.
But now I see you lack vision.
So, either you'll come willingly...
Or you won't. Either way,
that's how I get to the Time-Keepers.
Right...
Of course I do.
You're not the only tech savvy Loki.
Tech savvy?
Fine. For my next trick,
I'll make you disappear.
Is that one of your powers?
I don't know what that means!
I'm sorry, madam.
Didn't have time to scan the brochure.
By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.
So we're a team now?
Get down!
You're so weird!
What are you doing?
You trying to enchant me?
It won't work.
No, because my mind is too strong.
Look. Are we really
about to do this here? Again?
I don't know. A truce?
Listen, neither of us
is getting off this rock
if we can't turn that TemPad turned back on.
In my heart.
Nice. Very droll. Lovely.
Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad,
but I'm not gonna get very far
if you keep trying to kill me every thirty seconds.
Maybe.
Yeah. I mean, sure. That too.
Or we could slaughter each other here
in this abandoned mining shack.
What do you say?
Okay, got it.
Good.
Or I'll kill you.
Where're you going?
Yep.
So, what's the plan?
All right, well... Slow down, Variant.
I'm sorry, but I'm not calling
some faded photocopy of me "Loki."
Oh you changed your name. Brilliant.
Well it's not very Loki-like.
Independence, authority, style.
I don't work for them.
I'm a... consultant.
Oh, yeah? What about you?
Your years-in-the-making plan
was to tear the place down,
create the ultimate power vacuum,
and then just walk away.
I'd never have done that.
It looks like everyone already fled.
How long do we have?
Could that charge the TemPad?
Right.
Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you.
You're gonna have to try harder than that.
Brute force is no substitute
for diplomacy and guile.
It's remarkable
that you ever made it as far as you did. 

Sorry about that.
Oh...  I did too.
But I can assure you,
despite my acquaintance
behaving like an animal...
...uh, we mean you no harm.
We're simply weary travelers.
Don't. Just don't.
How do we get there?
Well, this looks fun.
We can't fight our way onto that train.
All your plans involve fighting.
Make him start shooting?
And then what, kill every guard
and hijack the train?
We're doing this one my way.
How do I look?
It's a great plan.
Just follow my lead.
Taking this one to Shuroo.
Orders come from the top
to get her on this train.
Okay.
Good evening, passengers. Hi.
Um, uh, look,
I can't go backwards on a train.
What? There are doors on both sides.
Oh, really?
Oh, you a bit tired?
Feel free to, you know, get some rest.
You can't sleep on a train?
Oh, right. That me?
Nice try.
My mother.
She was, um...
A Queen of Asgard.
She was good. Purely decent.
Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted.
Is that a bit of a spoiler for you?
Sorry about that.
No, I knew I was adopted.
What? They told you?
No.
I mean, I mean, they, they did eventually.
Hang on a second.
So, tell... Tell me about your mother.
You know, when I was young, she'd do
these little bits of magic for me.
Like turn a flower into a frog
or cast fireworks over the water.
It all seemed impossible.
But she told me that
I'd be able to do it too because...
Because I could do anything.
You wanna see?
She was the kinda person
you'd want to believe in you.
Well, she did.
So, where'd you learn to do the...
You know, the... Whatever it is?
You taught yourself that magic?
What, do you just...
You just go into their minds
and project some sort of illusion?
Enchanted me and take the TemPad
and leap out the train?
No, thank you.
Okay.
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.
Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you.
Cheers. 
To the end of the world. 
A pity the old woman chose to die,
don't you think?
She hated him.
Should probably remember that.

What was that?  "Love is... Love is hate."
So, on the subject of love,
is there a lucky beau waiting for you
at the end of this crusade?
Oh.
Managed to maintain quite a serious
long-distance relationship with a postman
whilst running across time from one apocalypse to another.
And with charm like that,
who could resist you?
I'm sure they are.
A bit of both. I suspect the same as you.
But, nothing ever...
Mmm...
No.
Love is...
uh, something I might have
to have another drink to think about.
I do.
All right. You relax your way
and I'll relax mine.
...når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,
men tranene danser og fosserne stanser.
Men tranene danser og fossene stanser
når hun synger hun synger kom hjem,
men tranene danser og fosserne stanser
I stormsvarte fjell, jeg vandrer alene
Over isbreen tar jeg meg frem
I eplehagen står møyen den vene
og synger “når kommer du hjem?”
Men tranene danser og fossene stanser
når hun synger, hun synger kom hjem
men tranene danser og fossene stanser
When she sings, she sings come home
To Sylvie, everybody!
Another!
No, I'm just full.
But bear in mind, I'm very full.
Now, I need you to try this. 
It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port.
Who's got the Figgy Port?
Well you'll just have to take my word
on the Figgy Port.
Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.
Yes.
Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.
What?
When did you get so paranoid?
It's a shame to let that go to waste.
Hey! Change of subject.
I thought of an answer.
Your question.
Love is a dagger.

It's a weapon
to be wielded far away or up close.
You can see yourself in it.
It's beautiful.
Until it makes you bleed.
But ultimately, when you reach for it...
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense, does it?
Damn. I thought I had something there.
It's gonna be fine.
You again. Hello.
Um, tickets.
Yes, of course. Here they are.
Oops.
Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?
Look, is this really necessary?
There is a simple explanation... Hey.
Oh, will you stop it?
Bye.
Well, that's not ideal.
All right. All right. Okay.
Well, I did take quite the tumble.
Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um...
You're right. I'm a god.
I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.
Oh, the mission? The mission?
What, your glorious purpose?
Give me a break. You can't beat them.
Okay.
Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?
What now?
Well...
Well, yes, but...
Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?
Including us.
What about the ark?
Never had us on it.
I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.
Really?
You know, I don't think
I've ever walked this much in my life.
Well, you're lucky you missed it.
Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me
and you could walk for both of us?
I take a nap in my subconscious,
and then you could just wake me
when we arrive. Yeah?
All right, how does it work?
You know, I feel like
I've told you so much about me.
I really don't know
the first thing about you.
Ah, so, you want to use
that tactical advantage to kill me
when the TVA shows up.
I just need to know if I can trust you.
How?
And you call me a magician.
What? What'd you just say?
Before she joined the TVA?
A regular person?
I was told that
everyone who works for the TVA
was created by the Time-Keepers.
We do and you can.
They're gonna let these people die.
How?
Okay.
You okay?
I've got it!
We can still make it!
Sylvie, come on!
So, you're part of the TVA's
courageous and dedicated workforce?
You were created by the Time-Keepers?
Enchantment is a clever trick.
How long do we have?
To the end of the world.
I'm sorry.
No.
We may lose.
Sometimes painfully.
But we don't die.
We survive.
I mean, you did.
You were just a child
when the TVA took you,
but you nearly took down the organization
that claims to govern the order of time.
You did it on your own.
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!
Well, what?
I don't have a quip.
I've got nothing to say.
By the way, I should have an equal amount
of security. This is insulting!
You betrayed me!
Oh grow up!
Oh, here it comes.
The folksy, dopey insult
from the folksy dope.
What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah?
The God of Back-Stabbing?
What is this?
Mobius!
The TVA is lying to you.
No.
What?

Seriously?
Sif!
What?
Ow.
All right.
A bad memory prison? How quaint.
Ow!
Some punishment. 
I remember exactly what I did after that.
I went and had a nice, hot bath
and a glass of wine,
and I never thought about it again,
because it was just a bit of fun.
Huh?
Hang on.
Ow.
Just...
Time loops. How lovely.
Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.
And I always will be.
All right, I get it.
Listen. You are a reconstruction
of a past event
created by the organization
that controls all of time.
So you need to trust me
and you need to help me escape. Yeah?
Okay, good.
Sif. Sif.
Please, please, no more.
Please, I beg you.
I'm a horrible person.
I get it. I really am.
I cut off your hair
because I thought it'd be funny.
And it's not.
Uh...
I crave attention...
because I'm...

I'm a... I'm a narcissist.
And I suppose it's...
It's because I'm scared of being alone.
Fancy technology.
Threatening interrogation tactics.
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.
Certainly has.
Let me out of this place,
stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.
Me? Working for her? Please.
Absolutely not.
She's difficult and irritating,
and she tries to hit me all the time.
No. Not partners, no.
It was a means to an end, Mobius.
Welcome to the real world.
Down there, we're awful
to get what we want.
Let me say this again.
I'm not going to tell you
just so you can turn around
immediately afterwards and prune me.
Okay, it's over.
Me, too.
What... No. What? No, no, no.
Please, not...
Well, just wait, wait, wait.
Of course it was me
pulling the strings all along.
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago
and then she took me
to one of her apocalypses
and that's where
we hatched our plan together.
Coming along very nicely, thank you.
Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.
Something very, very big is gonna happen.
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.
Hang on, wait.
What'd you just say?
The Variant. She's gone?
Good riddance.
What's so funny?
What?
Was she pruned?
Tell me the truth.
Her name was Sylvie.
Is she alive?
Our interests are aligned.
Maybe they need to be overthrown.
Mobius, listen.
If what Sylvie told me about this place
is true, it affects all of us.
I'm not lying.
It's the truth.
She's not my girlfriend.
You're all Variants!
Everyone who works at the TVA.
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline,
and erased your memories.
Memories she can access
through enchantment.
So before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.
You know, of all the liars in this place,
and there are a great many,
you're the biggest.
Oh, no. That I can respect.
I mean, the lies you tell yourself.
I've heard it once,
I've heard it a thousand times.
"You. You conniving, craven,
pathetic worm. You did this."
Right?
Passing the time.
Sylvie? I'm not sure
if "care" is the right word.
We've covered this back in there.
You told me to shut up.
I don't know.
"We"?
Mobius, no. I believe her.
How about the word of a friend?
Yes.
Is that the only reason
you brought us here?
To kill us?
I've lost track of the number of times
I've been killed, so go ahead.
Do your worst.
A little help here?
Wait.
Don't.
It never stops.
Then who created the TVA?
Sylvie...
No, I have to tell you something.
We will figure this out.
Because, uh...
Well, back on Lamentis...
This is new for me. Um...
Is this Hel?
Am I dead?
